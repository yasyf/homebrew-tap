# Homebrew formula for cc-notes. Installs the prebuilt binary for the
# current platform from cc-notes' GitHub Releases — no Go toolchain
# needed. `brew install --HEAD` builds (pure Go) from source instead.
#
#   brew install yasyf/tap/cc-notes
#
# The FUSE-capable build ships everywhere one is published (macOS both
# arches, linux/amd64) and runs fine without FUSE present — only
# `cc-notes mount` needs fuse-t (macOS) or fuse3 (Linux) at runtime. If
# asset names or the fuse matrix change, scripts/install.sh and the
# bump-formula seds in .github/workflows/release.yml (in cc-notes) must
# change in lockstep.
#
# This file is generated and pushed by cc-notes' release.yml bump-formula
# job on every stable tag; edit the template there, not here.
